            <p> My PhD project consisted of several sub-projects. These are some
                of them.</p>
            <h3>Field test on custom chimney</h3>
              <p>This work was done by designing, constructing and executing a
              field experiment on a 35.5 m tall industrial chimney with a tip
              diameter of 2 m. This chimney was placed in a monitored field
              and the wind speed near it and the acceleration of chimney was
              measured. The main finding was that the displacement was
              dependent on the incoming atmospheric boundary layer which
              varied with direction and had turbulence intensities much lower
              than the design codes suggested

            <h3>2D wind tunnel tests at super-critical Reynolds numbers</h3>
              <p>This work was done by measuring the unsteady pressure around
              a cylinder and the wake characteristics behind it. Conventionally,
              the shedding behavior behind cylinder evolves with the Reynolds
              number like in Fig. 1. The tests revealed new knowledge on the
              shedding frequency on large cylinders contradictorary to this
              simple grapg that we hope to publish soon. In addition, the work
              made it possible to determine the best surface roughness for
              simulating super-critical Reynolds numbers  (>10<sup>6</sup>) at
              lower ones. This was done using regularly attached surface ribs
              with a rectangular cross-section.

            <h3>3D  response of cylinders at super-critical Reynolds numbers</h3>
              <p> In addition to determining the aerodynamics around a cylinder,
              we found ways to simulate the response of chimneys at super-critical
              Reynolds numbers  (>10<sup>6</sup>) using roughness and a turbulent atmospheric boundary
              layer. These tests revealed that the boundary layer was an important
              factor when simulating the response. By combining these tests with
              predictive models, the best model for a given situation was found.

            <h3>Predicting the response due to vortex-induced vibrations</h3>
              <p> The current design models used in the Eurocode either cannot
                predict amplitude responses or fails to predict them when the
                Scruton number (a mass-damping parameter) is low. An attempt to
                fix both of these problems was done by deriving an analytical
                expression for the response due to vortex-induced vibrations.
                This was done by approximating an existing nonlinear wake oscillator
                (by <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0889974603001853?casa_token=OHZFjnxuzpcAAAAA:yflFg0xNJpJsoKjyCIGQMZqqosGG7v6nqteaQNpWCIdkh3JKPzCO8Sx9e4j2HV_TekSJDcXy">Facchinetti et al.</a>)
                using the method of averaging. The approximated model matched well
                with numerical integrations and the response of cylinders with
                low Scruton numbers. With this model, an equation for the lock-in
                region could be derived and its changes with mass and damping was explored.

          <h2> Heat pumps</h2>
            <h3>Two-stage high temperature hybrid heat pump with parallel heat sinks</h3>
              <p> This work was done during an internship with Sintef Energy.
              The aim of this work was to determine if a single high temperature
              heat pump could supply enough heat for two sinks at different
              temperatures. We achieved this but needed to put in extra
              heat exchangers. </p>
